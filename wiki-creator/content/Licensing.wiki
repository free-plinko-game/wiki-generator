Gambling licensing in Australia is a regulatory framework that governs the operation of gambling activities within the country. It distinguishes between online and land-based gambling, with specific jurisdictions responsible for issuing different types of licences. The Northern Territory is notably the primary jurisdiction for online gambling licences.

== Licensing Framework in Australia ==
Gambling activities in Australia are regulated at both the federal and state/territory levels. Each state and territory has its own regulatory body responsible for issuing licences and overseeing compliance. The distinction between online and land-based gambling is significant, with the Northern Territory being a key jurisdiction for online gambling licences.

== Types of Licences ==
Various types of licences are available for different gambling activities:

* '''Sports Bookmaker Licence''': Allows operators to offer betting on sports events.
* '''Betting Exchange Licence''': Permits the operation of a platform where individuals can bet against each other.
* '''Casino Licence''': Required for the operation of a casino.
* '''Gaming Machine Licence''': Necessary for venues offering gaming machines, such as poker machines.
* '''Lottery Licence''': Required for conducting lottery games.

== Online vs Land-Based Licensing ==
The Northern Territory is the primary jurisdiction for online gambling licences, attracting many operators due to its favourable regulatory environment. In contrast, land-based gambling licences are typically issued by the state or territory where the physical venue is located.

== Licence Application Process ==
The application process for a gambling licence involves several steps, including the submission of detailed business plans, financial statements, and compliance with probity and suitability requirements. Applicants must demonstrate their capability to operate responsibly and in accordance with the law.

== Probity and Suitability Requirements ==
Applicants for gambling licences must meet strict probity and suitability standards. This includes background checks on key personnel and ensuring that the business structure and financial arrangements are transparent and lawful.

== Ongoing Compliance Obligations ==
Licensed operators must adhere to ongoing compliance obligations, which include regular reporting, adherence to responsible gambling measures, and cooperation with regulatory audits.
