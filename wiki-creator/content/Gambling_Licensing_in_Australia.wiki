Gambling licensing in Australia is governed by a combination of federal and state/territory laws. The federal government primarily regulates online gambling, while each state and territory manages land-based gambling operations within its jurisdiction. This dual system ensures that both national and local interests are addressed in the regulation of gambling activities.

== Federal vs State Jurisdiction ==
In Australia, the regulation of gambling is divided between federal and state/territory governments. The federal government, through the [[Interactive Gambling Act 2001]], oversees online gambling services, prohibiting certain online gambling activities and regulating the advertising of these services. Meanwhile, each state and territory has its own regulatory body responsible for licensing and regulating land-based gambling, such as casinos, poker machines, and betting shops.

== Online vs Land-Based Licensing ==
Online gambling services must comply with federal laws and obtain licenses from the relevant state or territory if they wish to operate legally in Australia. Land-based gambling, such as casinos and gaming machines, is licensed and regulated by the respective state or territory authorities. Each jurisdiction has its own set of rules and requirements for obtaining and maintaining a gambling license.

== Types of Licences ==
There are several types of gambling licenses available in Australia, including:
* Casino Licenses
* Gaming Machine Licenses
* Bookmaker Licenses
* Lottery Licenses
* Interactive Gambling Licenses
