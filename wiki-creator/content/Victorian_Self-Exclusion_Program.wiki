The Victorian Self-Exclusion Program is a harm minimisation initiative designed to help individuals in Victoria, Australia, voluntarily exclude themselves from gambling venues, including casinos and gaming machine areas. This program is an essential component of the state's consumer protection measures in the gambling sector.

== Venue-Based Exclusion ==
The Victorian Self-Exclusion Program allows individuals to exclude themselves from specific gambling venues across Victoria. This exclusion applies to areas within these venues where gambling activities occur, such as gaming machine areas and casinos. The program aims to support individuals who wish to control their gambling habits by restricting access to environments that may trigger gambling behaviour.

== YourPlay Integration ==
YourPlay is a voluntary pre-commitment system available in Victoria that allows gamblers to set limits on their gambling activities. The self-exclusion program is integrated with YourPlay, providing an additional layer of support for individuals who choose to self-exclude. This integration ensures that self-excluded individuals are also restricted from using their YourPlay accounts in excluded venues.

== Crown Melbourne Self-Exclusion ==
Crown Melbourne, one of the largest casinos in Australia, offers its own self-exclusion program as part of the broader Victorian Self-Exclusion Program. Individuals can choose to exclude themselves specifically from Crown Melbourne, ensuring they cannot access the casino's gaming areas. This program is tailored to address the unique environment of Crown Melbourne and provides additional support and resources for those who self-exclude.

== Registration Process ==
The registration process for the Victorian Self-Exclusion Program involves several steps to ensure that individuals are fully informed and supported throughout their decision to self-exclude. The process typically includes:
* Completing a self-exclusion form, which can be obtained from participating venues or the [[Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission]].
* Attending a meeting with a program representative to discuss the terms of the exclusion and available support services.
* Signing an agreement that outlines the conditions of the self-exclusion, including the duration and specific venues from which the individual wishes to be excluded.
