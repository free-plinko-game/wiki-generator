Social casino games are free-to-play digital games that simulate traditional casino games such as slots, poker, and blackjack. These games are typically available on social media platforms, mobile apps, and websites. Unlike real-money gambling, social casino games do not offer cash prizes, and their primary purpose is entertainment.

== Definition and Features ==
Social casino games are characterized by their free-to-play model, where players can enjoy casino-style games without wagering real money. These games often include features such as:
* Virtual currency that can be purchased with real money
* Social interaction through leaderboards and friend challenges
* Frequent updates with new games and features

== Legal Status ==
Social casino games are generally not classified as gambling under Australian law because they do not offer real-money prizes. The absence of a financial reward means they do not meet the legal definition of gambling, which typically requires the staking of money on an outcome with the potential for a monetary return.

== In-App Purchases ==
While social casino games are free to play, they often include in-app purchases. Players can buy virtual currency or items to enhance their gaming experience. This monetization strategy is a significant revenue stream for developers, despite the games being free to access.

== Harm Concerns ==
There are concerns about the potential harm of social casino games, particularly regarding their addictive nature and the use of in-app purchases. Critics argue that these games can encourage excessive spending and may serve as a gateway to real-money gambling, especially among younger audiences.

== Gateway to Real Gambling ==
Research suggests that social casino games may act as a gateway to real gambling. The immersive experience and the use of virtual currency can normalize gambling behaviors, potentially leading players to transition to real-money gambling activities.
