Blackjack is a popular card game played in Australian casinos, known for its blend of chance and strategy. The objective of the game is to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, while competing against the dealer.

== Rules Overview ==
In blackjack, players are dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" (take additional cards) or "stand" (keep their current hand) in an attempt to reach a hand value of 21. Face cards are worth 10 points, aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value. The dealer must follow specific rules, typically hitting until they reach a hand value of 17 or higher.

== Australian Rule Variations ==
Australian casinos may implement variations to the standard blackjack rules, including:
* The use of multiple decks, often six to eight decks shuffled together.
* Dealers hitting on soft 17 (a hand containing an ace valued as 11).
* Restrictions on doubling down, such as only allowing it on certain hand totals.
* The option to surrender, allowing players to forfeit half their bet and end the hand.

== House Edge ==
The house edge in blackjack varies depending on the specific rules of the game. In Australian casinos, the house edge typically ranges from 0.5% to 1%, assuming optimal player strategy.

== Basic Strategy ==
Basic strategy in blackjack involves making decisions based on the player's hand and the dealer's upcard to minimize the house edge. This includes guidelines for when to hit, stand, double down, or split pairs. Players can refer to strategy charts that outline the optimal action for every possible hand combination.

== Card Counting ==
Card counting is a technique used to gain an advantage by keeping track of the ratio of high to low cards remaining in the deck. While card counting is legal in Australia, casinos discourage the practice and may take measures to prevent it, such as banning players suspected of counting cards.
