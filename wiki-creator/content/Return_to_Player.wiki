'''Return to Player''' (RTP) is a term used in gambling to describe the percentage of all wagered money that a game is expected to pay back to players over time. It is a key metric for understanding the potential payout of a game and is calculated as RTP = 100% - House Edge. RTP is expressed as a percentage and reflects the theoretical return that players can expect from a game over a long period.

== Definition and Calculation ==
RTP is calculated by subtracting the house edge from 100%. For example, if a game has a house edge of 5%, the RTP would be 95%. This means that, theoretically, for every $100 wagered, $95 is expected to be returned to players, while $5 is retained by the house as profit.

== Theoretical vs Actual RTP ==
Theoretical RTP is an average calculated over a large number of game rounds, reflecting the expected return to players. Actual RTP, however, can vary in the short term due to the random nature of games. Over time, the actual RTP should align closely with the theoretical RTP.

== Long-term vs Short-term Variance ==
In the short term, players may experience significant variance, with actual returns deviating from the theoretical RTP. Over the long term, the law of large numbers suggests that the actual RTP will converge towards the theoretical RTP, providing a more accurate reflection of the game's payout potential.

== RTP by Game Type ==
Different types of games have varying RTP percentages. The following table outlines typical RTP ranges for common casino games:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Game Type !! Typical RTP Range
|-
| Slot Machines || 85% - 98%
|-
| Blackjack || 99%+
|-
| Roulette || 94% - 97%
|-
| Poker || 95% - 99%
|-
| Baccarat || 98%+
|}

== Australian Minimum RTP Requirements by State ==
In Australia, gambling regulations mandate minimum RTP percentages for games, which can vary by state and territory. The following table provides an overview of these requirements:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! State/Territory !! Minimum RTP
|-
| New South Wales || 85%
|-
| Victoria || 87%
|-
| Queensland || 85%
|-
| South Australia || 87.5%
|-
| Western Australia || 90%
|-
| Tasmania || 85%
|-
| Northern Territory || 85%
|-
| Australian Capital Territory || 88%
|}

== How to Find RTP Information ==
RTP information is often available in the game rules or paytable, which can be accessed through the game's interface. Additionally, online casinos may provide RTP data on their websites, and regulatory bodies may publish RTP statistics for licensed games.

== Common Misconceptions ==
A common misconception is that RTP guarantees a specific outcome in a single session. In reality, RTP is an average expected return over a long period, and individual sessions can result in outcomes that are significantly higher or lower than the RTP.
