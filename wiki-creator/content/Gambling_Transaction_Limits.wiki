Gambling transaction limits refer to the restrictions placed on the amount of money that can be deposited into or withdrawn from gambling accounts. These limits are set by gambling operators and can also be self-imposed by players. They are designed to promote responsible gambling and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

== Deposit Limits ==
Deposit limits are the maximum amounts that players can add to their gambling accounts within a specified period. These limits can be set by the gambling operator or chosen by the player as a self-imposed measure to control gambling expenditure.

=== Operator-Set Limits ===
Operators often set default deposit limits to comply with regulatory standards and promote responsible gambling. These limits can vary between different operators and jurisdictions.

=== Self-Imposed Limits ===
Players have the option to set their own deposit limits, which can be lower than the operator-set limits. This feature allows players to manage their gambling budget and prevent excessive spending.

== Withdrawal Limits ==
Withdrawal limits refer to the maximum amount of money that can be withdrawn from a gambling account within a certain timeframe. These limits are typically set by the operator and can vary based on the payment method used.

== VIP Exceptions ==
VIP players may be granted higher deposit and withdrawal limits as part of loyalty programs. These exceptions are typically offered to high-value customers and are subject to the operator's discretion.

== Regulatory Requirements ==
Regulatory bodies in Australia, such as the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), mandate certain transaction limits to protect consumers and promote responsible gambling. Operators must adhere to these regulations to maintain their licenses.
