PayID is a payment method that allows users to make instant and secure transactions using a simple identifier, such as a phone number or email address, instead of traditional bank account details. In the context of gambling, PayID facilitates quick deposits to gambling operators, enhancing the user experience by reducing transaction times.

== How PayID Works with Gambling Operators ==
PayID enables gamblers to deposit funds into their gambling accounts instantly. Users link their bank account to a PayID, which can be used to transfer money directly to the gambling operator's account. This process eliminates the need for lengthy bank details, making transactions quicker and more convenient.

== Instant Deposits ==
One of the primary advantages of using PayID for gambling transactions is the ability to make instant deposits. Unlike traditional bank transfers, which may take several days to process, PayID transactions are completed in real-time, allowing users to start gambling immediately after depositing funds.

== Security Considerations ==
PayID transactions are secured through bank-level encryption and authentication processes. Users do not need to share their bank account details with gambling operators, reducing the risk of sensitive information being compromised. Additionally, PayID transactions are monitored by financial institutions, providing an extra layer of security.

== Operators Accepting PayID ==
Many Australian gambling operators have started accepting PayID as a payment method due to its convenience and security. The following table lists some of the operators known to accept PayID:
