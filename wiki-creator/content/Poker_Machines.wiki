Poker machines, commonly referred to as "pokies," are a popular form of gambling in Australia. These electronic gaming machines are found in various venues across the country, including clubs, hotels, and casinos. They are subject to regulation by state and territory governments, with each jurisdiction having specific laws regarding their operation.

== History in Australia ==
Poker machines were first introduced in Australia in the 1950s. Initially, they were only available in New South Wales (NSW), but their popularity led to their spread across other states and territories. Today, pokies are a significant source of revenue for both the venues that host them and the governments that regulate them.

== Legal Status by State ==
Poker machines are legal in all Australian states and territories, except Western Australia, where they are restricted to the casino in Perth.

== Club vs Hotel Pokies ==
In Australia, poker machines are commonly found in both clubs and hotels. Clubs, often community-based, may offer more machines and have different operational rules compared to hotels. The distribution and number of machines are typically regulated by state authorities.

== WA Casino-Only Rule ==
Western Australia is unique in its approach to poker machines, allowing them only within the confines of the Crown Perth casino. This restriction aims to limit the accessibility of pokies and reduce gambling-related harm.

== How Pokies Work ==
Poker machines operate using random number generators (RNGs) to determine the outcome of each spin. Players insert money, select their bet, and spin the reels, hoping to match symbols for a payout. The machines are programmed to return a certain percentage of money wagered over time, known as the Return to Player (RTP).

== RTP Requirements by State ==
Each state and territory in Australia has its own RTP requirements for poker machines, generally ranging from 85% to 90%.

== Maximum Bet Limits ==
Maximum bet limits on poker machines vary by state, with typical limits ranging from $5 to $10 per spin. These limits are intended to reduce the potential for significant financial loss in a short period.

== Harm Minimisation Measures ==
Australian states and territories implement various harm minimisation measures to protect players. These include mandatory pre-commitment systems, limits on cash input, and requirements for responsible gambling messages on machines.

== Number of Machines by State ==
The number of poker machines varies significantly across states, with New South Wales having the highest number.
