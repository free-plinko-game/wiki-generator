State and territory regulators in Australia are responsible for the oversight and regulation of gambling activities within their respective jurisdictions. While the federal government, through the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), oversees certain aspects of online gambling, the regulation of land-based gambling is primarily the responsibility of individual states and territories. Each jurisdiction has its own regulatory body to manage and enforce gambling laws, ensuring compliance with local legislation.

== Federal vs State/Territory Jurisdiction ==
In Australia, gambling regulation is divided between federal and state/territory governments. The federal government, through agencies like the ACMA, regulates aspects of online gambling, particularly in relation to advertising and the prohibition of certain types of online gambling services. However, the regulation of land-based gambling, including casinos, gaming machines, and wagering, is managed by state and territory governments. Each jurisdiction has established its own regulatory body to administer these activities, reflecting local laws and community standards.

== Land-based vs Online Gambling Regulation ==
Land-based gambling activities, such as casinos and gaming machines, are regulated by state and territory authorities. These regulators are responsible for licensing, compliance, and enforcement within their jurisdictions. Online gambling, on the other hand, is subject to both federal and state/territory oversight. The ACMA plays a significant role in regulating online gambling, particularly in enforcing the Interactive Gambling Act 2001, which prohibits certain online gambling services.
