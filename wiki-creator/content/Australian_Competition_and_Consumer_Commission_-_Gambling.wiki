The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) plays a significant role in the protection of consumers within the gambling sector in Australia. It is responsible for ensuring that gambling operators comply with consumer protection laws, particularly in relation to misleading advertising, unfair contract terms, and other deceptive practices.

== Consumer Protection Jurisdiction ==
The ACCC's jurisdiction in consumer protection extends to the gambling industry, where it enforces the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). This includes addressing issues such as false or misleading representations, unconscionable conduct, and unfair practices that may affect consumers engaging with gambling services.

== Misleading Advertising Enforcement ==
The ACCC actively monitors and enforces laws against misleading advertising in the gambling industry. This involves ensuring that gambling advertisements are clear, truthful, and do not mislead consumers about the odds, potential winnings, or the nature of the gambling products offered.

== Unfair Contract Terms ==
The ACCC also addresses unfair contract terms within the gambling industry. It reviews terms and conditions imposed by gambling operators to ensure they are fair and transparent. Unfair terms that create a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations to the detriment of the consumer may be challenged by the ACCC.

== Relationship with ACMA and State Regulators ==
The ACCC collaborates with the [[ACMA]] (Australian Communications and Media Authority) and state regulators to ensure a comprehensive regulatory framework for gambling. While the ACCC focuses on consumer protection aspects, ACMA handles issues related to broadcasting and online content, and state regulators oversee licensing and operational compliance.
