Gambling in colonial Australia (1788-1901) was a significant aspect of social life, influenced by the penal colony's unique societal structure and the gradual development of regulatory frameworks. The colonial era saw the establishment of horse racing, the emergence of state-based regulation, and the integration of gambling into convict society.

== Early Gambling Laws ==
During the colonial era, gambling was initially unregulated, reflecting the informal and often chaotic nature of early Australian society. However, as the colonies developed, there was a growing need to control gambling activities. The first gambling laws were introduced to curb excessive gambling and maintain public order. These laws were often rudimentary and varied significantly between different colonies.

== Horse Racing Establishment ==
Horse racing was one of the first organized forms of gambling in Australia. The first official horse race took place in Sydney in 1810, marking the beginning of a long tradition of horse racing in the country. This event was held at Hyde Park and was organized by officers of the New South Wales Corps. Horse racing quickly became a popular pastime and a significant social event, leading to the establishment of more formal racing clubs and events.
