Land-based gambling in Australia refers to gambling activities that occur in physical venues such as casinos, clubs, hotels, and racing venues.

Poker machines, also known as pokies, are prevalent in clubs and hotels across Australia, with the exception of Western Australia where they are restricted to the casino. The number of machines and regulations vary by state:

* '''New South Wales''': Approximately 85,000 machines, the largest market.
* '''Victoria''': Approximately 27,000 machines.
* '''Queensland''': Approximately 45,000 machines.

== Western Australia Exception ==
Western Australia is unique in that poker machines are only permitted within the casino, unlike other states where they are also found in clubs and hotels.

== Minimum RTP Requirements ==
Each state imposes minimum Return to Player (RTP) requirements for poker machines to ensure a fair chance for players. These requirements are part of the regulatory framework to protect consumers.

== Harm Minimisation Measures ==
Harm minimisation measures are implemented across all land-based gambling venues to reduce the risk of problem gambling. These include limits on machine operation hours, mandatory breaks, and responsible gambling messaging.

== Self-Exclusion ==
Self-exclusion programs are available in all states and territories, allowing individuals to voluntarily ban themselves from entering gambling venues. These schemes are part of broader efforts to support individuals with gambling problems.
